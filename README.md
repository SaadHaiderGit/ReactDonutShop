# React Donut Shop

This is a very simple website for a donut shop website, making use of React components to create a dynamic site that can list various donuts for sale. You can also access a donut database through an adminstrative page, allowing you to make changes to the donut menu.

## Setup and Usage

This website was made using XAMPP's Apache server, allowing for PHP and mySQL/MariaDB use. You can download XAMPP at https://www.apachefriends.org/. Make sure to have Apache, MySQL, PHP, and phpMyAdmin checked when  running the installation wizard.

When you want to run a server using XAMPP, simply open up the XAMPP control panel, then click the "Start" action for both Apache and mySQL.

Download the Github repository and save it in xampp\htdocs\Projects. Then start running your server, and access the index.html file. My server runs on port 8080, so I use the following link: http://localhost:8080/projects/ReactDonutShop/index.html

You can access the admin page by using a similar link, with index.html replaced by admin.html. My server runs on port 8080, so I use the following link: http://localhost:8080/projects/ReactDonutShop/index.html

Instructions for manipulating the donut database are found on the admin page, and should be self-explanatory.
