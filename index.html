                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>
                    Ali Baba's Fabulous Donuts was the dream business of our father, Ali Baba, who moved from Cairo, Egypt during 
                    the revolution to the lovely town of Dearborn, Michigan. Donuts were one of his all-time favorite sweets, and 
                    one day, he decided to risk it all and open up shop, creating the titular business.
                    <br/><br/>
                    New weekly products was Ali Baba's idea of innovation. Allured and excited by the idea of new donuts that would  
                    be rotated into stock, he believed it would prove a staple for his business and attract interest in the community. 
                    And so it has! People flocked to the store from day one, interested in finding what donuts would be up for sale 
                    every passing week, and many found it a great place for a quick morning dessert and for parlour discussions 
                    with friends and fellows.  
                    <br/><br/>
                    We're still going strong at 50 years, and we mean to stay for another 50! Through your patronage, we relive 
                    the joys of our father Ali Baba and his passion for donut-baking. To you all, we extend our deepest thank-you's.
